# Rosé Pine for Desmos Desktop

> Maintained by our lovely community ☺️

All natural pine, faux fur and a bit of soho vibes for the classy minimalist.

Re-work of [this](https://github.com/DingShizhe/Desmos-Desktop).

## Usage

***If you are on Linux, I highly reccomend you use the prebuilt AppImage alongside AppImageLauncher from the Releases tab!!***

If building from source, you will need Node.js (with npm) and Electron

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rose-pine/desmos-desktop.git && cd desmos-desktop
npm install -d
npm run dist
cd dist && ls 
```

If you're on Linux and have decided not to download the AppImage and instead build it from source for some forsaken reason, you need to edit `./res/appimagekit-desmos.desktop` properly and move it to `~/.local/share/applications`.
