# Rosé Pine

All natural pine, faux fur and a bit of soho vibes for the classy minimalist.

"Inspired" by [possibly the worst code I have ever seen. Like seriously, why.](https://github.com/DingShizhe/Desmos-Desktop)

### Prereqiusites

Building from source:

 - Node.js
 - Electron
 - npm
 - half a brain

### Instructions

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rose-pine/desmos-desktop.git && cd desmos-desktop
npm install -d
npm run dist
cd dist && ls 
```

If you're on Linux and have decided not to download the AppImage and instead build it from source for some forsaken reason, you need edit `./res/appimagekit-desmos.desktop` properly and move it to `.local/share/applications`.
